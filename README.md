### Low Level Procedures

Low Level Procedures
====================

Objectives
----------

> This chapter explains TestComplete Low Level Procedure functionality
> and how it can be leveraged to deal with situations where they may be
> no easy alternative. You'll learn how to record, edit and execute Low
> Level Procedures. Along the way you will learn how Low-Level
> Procedures differ from standard test recordings, when to use a
> Low-Level Procedure and the difference between Window and Screen Low
> Level Procedures.

About Low Level Procedures
--------------------------

> Low Level Procedures are an alternative recording type provided by
> TestComplete where actual mouse and keyboard events are recorded. Low
> Level Procedures differ dramatically from standard recordings where
> TestComplete records higher level actions against specific onscreen
> objects.

#### Low Level Procedure Types

> There are two kinds of Low Level Procedures:
>
> **Screen Coordinates** \-- Captures events relative to the entire
> screen where the top left-hand corner of the screen is 0,0.
>
> **Window Coordinates** \-- Captures events relative to a user selected
> Window where the top left-hand corner of the window is 0,0.
>
> Window Coordinate Low Level Procedures tend to be more reliable as
> they are unaffected by the location of the selected window and will
> playback relative to the Window\'s current screen location.

#### When To Use Low Level Procedures

> From the outset, tests that rely on screen coordinates generally are a
> bad idea and usually that holds true regardless of which tool you're
> using. However, in certain situations you may find yourself attempting
> to record a scenario that simply refuses to playback properly due to
> the complexity of capturing a user\'s intent via a recorder. In these
> cases, resorting to Low Level Procedures can, at the very least, serve
> as a stop-gap until alternative solutions can be developed.
>
> Additionally, you can work on applications using third party controls
> not directly supported by TestComplete and that provide no visibility
> into the client region of the control such as a custom grid.

Recording Low Level Procedures
------------------------------

> In the \"Web Testing\" chapter we looked at a Web application that
> used JavaScript to dynamically display menu items on screen. The
> application poses an interesting challenge for GUI recorders that tend
> to capture interactions with controls such as clicks and keystrokes.
> Let\'s take a look at recording a Low-Level Window Coordinates
> Procedure to handle the menu selection and understand this alternative
> approach to recording.

#### Low Level Window Coordinates Procedure

67. For starters we\'ll launch Internet Explorer and browse to the
    Orders application located here:

> [http:*//training.falafel.com/dynamiccontent*](http://training.falafel.com/dynamiccontent)

68. Select **File \| New \| Project\...** and on the **Create Project**
    dialog click the **OK** button.

69. Start recording a new test. From the Recorder toolbar, drop down the
    Low-Level Procedure button and select the **Record Low-Level
    Procedure (window coordinates)** option.

> **Figure 226 \--Selecting from a Dynamic Menu**

74. Click the **Stop** button on the recording toolbar.

#### Examining the Recording

> At the completion of the recording you can see that a \"LLCollection\"
> has been added in the Project Explorer. Inside the collection will be
> the Low-Level Procedure you recorded.

> The columns in the Low-level Procedure Editor are:

  **Column**   **Value**
  ------------ ------------------------------------------
  **Icon**     Indicator of the type of event performed
  **N**        Ordinal value of this event in the list
  **Event**    Type of action to be performed

  **Column**       **Value**
  ---------------- --------------------------------------
  **Parameters**   Data specific to the specified event
  **Delay, ms**    Delay in milliseconds between events

> From the Low-level Procedure Editor window, you can add, edit and
> delete events from the list using the right click context menu.

Calling Low Level Procedures from Script
----------------------------------------

> To run a Low Level Procedure from a Keyword Test, first specify the
> collection followed by a period \".\", then the name of the low level
> procedure, another period \".\" and finally the **Execute()** method.
> If you want the low-level procedure to execute in relation to a
> particular window, pass the window as a parameter to the Execute
> method. Also notice in the example below that before executing the
> low-level procedure, you want to make sure that the window is
> activated and brought to the front.
>
> **var** iexplore = Aliases.iexplore.IEFrame; iexplore.Activate();
> LLCollection1.LLP1.Execute(iexplore);
>
> **Dim** iexplore = Aliases.iexplore.IEFrame iexplore.Activate()
> LLCollection1.LLP1.Execute(iexplore)

### User Forms

User Forms
==========

Objectives
----------

> This chapter demonstrates how User Forms are used to display dialogs
> and windows onscreen during test execution. You\'ll learn how to use
> the TestComplete User Form\'s designer to create your own forms.
> You\'ll also see how modal and non-modal display modes manage form
> display during test execution.

[]{#Materials .anchor}

> **Using the Designer**
>
> User Forms are not part of the default project template so you\'ll
> first need to add the **User Forms** Project Item to your project.
> Once you\'ve added User Forms support to your project you can right
> click the User Forms node in the Project Explorer and add a form to
> your project. In this example, we\'ll construct a User Form that can
> be used to prompt for login credentials.

![](./media/image322.png){width="2.613190069991251in"
height="1.8356244531933508in"}

> **Figure 231 \--User Form s Login Dialog**
>
> Once the form is created you will see the User Forms designer which is
> similar in style to those seen in Visual Basic, Visual Studio or other
> development tools supporting forms development. If you are familiar
> with any of these tools you\'ll immediately feel right at home in the
> designer. If not, don\'t fear. Learning the designer is quick and easy
> and you\'ll be able to construct dialogs in no time.

#### Layout of the User Forms Designer

> There are three panels of the User Forms editor including:

75. Component palette

76. Form Designer

77. Properties window

![](./media/image323.png){width="5.950223097112861in"
height="3.9459372265966755in"}

> **Figure 232 \--User Forms Editor**

#### Building a User Form

> To illustrate the functionality of the User Forms designer we\'ll
> build a Login dialog that you can call from within your tests. If the
> UserForms node doesn\'t already exist in the project explorer,
> right-click the project and select **Add \| New Item**. Choose \"User
> Forms\" from the list and click **OK** to create the project item.

![](./media/image324.png){width="4.3459667541557305in"
height="3.5833333333333335in"}

> **Figure 233 \--Adding User Forms**
>
> To create the form, right click the Project Explorer **UserForms**
> node and select **Add \| New Item\...** In the **Name** edit box enter
> \"PasswordDlg\".

height="1.9903116797900262in"}

> **Figure 234 \--Adding a User Form**
>
> Using the Component palette, we\'ll add the components (TcxTextEdit,
> TcxLabel and TcxButton) from the **Editors**, **Helpers** and
> **Buttons** categories respectively to the form by simply double
> clicking the components. After adding a component to the design-time
> form you can use the mouse to move/size the control and the Properties
> window to change its appearance/behavior. We now have a form that
> looks like this:

![](./media/image326.png){width="5.926007217847769in"
height="2.900624453193351in"}

> **Figure 235 \--Initial User Forms Layout**
>
> Next, we need to make the following property changes on the components
> placed on the form. The table below lists the components and the
> property/values for each. These changes improve the appearance of the
> dialog as well as set the expected behavior of a modal login dialog.

### Best Practices

> **Objectives**
>
> This chapter includes real-world advice on how to plan, organize and
> version control your tests. Other handy tips tell you how to get the
> most out of \"smoke tests\" and how to communicate your test results
> with the team.
>
> []{#Communicating_Test_Results .anchor}**Communicating Test Results**
>
> Now you might be thinking \"huh? I haven\'t even started yet and I
> have to think about communicating my results?\" The answer is a
> resounding YES! Unfortunately, Quality Assurance and test automation
> specifically, at least in the software world, tends to get a bad rap.
> Creating solid test automation that can stand up over time and provide
> valuable ongoing feedback is a difficult task which leads a lot of
> people (read management) to think time and effort spent working on
> automation is wasted.
>
> To solve this problem, you'll want to focus on getting your test
> results published quickly and consistently to prove that your efforts
> are worth the investment. TestComplete provides some facilities for
> producing log output though you'll want to be sure and iron out your
> strategy from the start. For example, you may want to setup a web
> server where you can publish results. In fact, TestComplete supports
> exporting log results to HTML which could be a good starting place.
>
> []{#Plan_your_testing,_but_not_that_kind_of_ .anchor}**Plan your
> testing, but not that kind of planning\...**
>
> The preparation we\'re referring to has to do with your choice of
> testing tool, TestComplete. Although it\'s important to plan the
> application features to be tested, it\'s also important to be prepared
> with respect to the testing facilities available in TestComplete. You
> should gain a thorough understanding of TestComplete features before
> you embark on writing test automation to avoid a situation where your
> weeks into test development only to discover a feature that could have
> saved you numerous hours or days.
>
> TestComplete is rich with features that make test automation easier
> although like any development tool it provides many different ways to
> solve the same problem. For example, TestComplete has a powerful and
> indeed almost alluring recorder, making it easy to quickly create
> automated tests. While a test recorder is a great tool, recorded tests
> tend to be more brittle than hand written tests because they capture a
> single iteration at a given point in time and don\'t take into account
> unexpected events like an error dialog popping up. The alternative is
> handwritten tests where you can methodically plan how the test will
> react in unexpected circumstances. The down side of handwritten tests
> is they tend to take longer to develop though over the long run
> they\'ll likely require less maintenance because of the tendency to
> design the test more rigorously.
>
> []{#Organizing_your_TestComplete_Projects .anchor}**Organizing your
> TestComplete Projects**
>
> TestComplete provides the ability to customize the Project Items that
> are included by default on a new project using Project Templates. In
> order to maintain consistency across your testing organization you
> should work towards creating a project template(s) that\'s
> pre-configured for your test environment. For example, if you\'re
> testing a Window 32-bit GUI application, create a Project Template
> that has the Tested Applications node with your application already
> added to it. Also, look closely at how you can utilize Aliases to
> avoid using long dotted object names like:
>
> Sys.Process(\"iexplore\").IEFrame(0).Window(\"WorkerW\", \"\",
> 1).Window( \"ReBarWindow32\", \"\", 1).Window(\"ComboBoxEx32\", \"\",
> 1).Window(
>
> \"ComboBox\", \"\", 1).Window(\"Edit\", \"\", 1)
>
> TestComplete includes an automatic Name Mapping feature has been added
> to make this even easier.
>
> []{#Use_a_Source_Control_Repository .anchor}**Use a Source Control
> Repository**
>
> TestComplete is a development tool and as such the projects, scripts,
> data, etc. used in your tests should be kept under version control. If
> this is something you\'re already doing, skip ahead. If not, you
> should consider version control the next priority and work to get your
> test suites under version control. There are lots of options including
> some excellent Open Source projects which are freely available like
> Subversion, otherwise known as SVN. While it\'s beyond the scope of
> this document to discuss the specific merits of source control it\'s a
> subject that shouldn\'t be ignored.
>
> []{#Your_Most_Important_Test .anchor}**Your Most Important Test**
>
> Arguably, the first test you should focus on is a \"smoke test\". In
> this section we\'ll discuss what a smoke test is and provide guidance
> as to how to construct the test in such a way as to maximize its
> effectiveness.

#### Creating a Smoke Test

> Probably the most important test you\'ll write is your Smoke Test, at
> least it should be. Typically, the goal of a Smoke Test is to verify
> that the latest build delivered to QA is either worth further
> consideration or \"DOA\" (dead on arrival). The smoke test is crucial
> because of the time savings it can provide both R&D and QA. A good
> Smoke Test should:
>
> Run quickly \-- a smoke test should not last for hours but minutes and
> test the most crucial functionality.
>
> Fail quickly \-- as soon as a failure is detected in the smoke test
> should end and trigger a failure notification.
>
> Cover a broad range of functionality, focusing on breadth not depth.
> Require minimal setup/configuration of the application under test. Be
> setup to run against every build.
>
> Adapt over time as the application under test evolves. Serve as a
> model for new test automation.
>
> If you take the time to organize your Smoke Test to cover these goals
> you will undoubtedly save time and resources over the long run. Your
> Smoke Test should serve as a model that embodies your \"best
> practices\" from which your QA team can draw from for their own tests.
>
> If you\'ve never written a Smoke Test before, start small. In the
> beginning simply get the smoke test to verify even a single piece of
> functionality consistently. Over time, work to increase its coverage
> but remain focused on the quality of the test. It\'s unacceptable to
> have a Smoke Test that can\'t run consistently and without problems.

#### Executing your Tests Regularly

> Once your Smoke Test is written and under version control the next
> step is to automate its execution. SmartBear has a product called
> Automated Build Studio which can automate your TestComplete tests and
> trigger them to execute when a new build is delivered to QA, a process
> called **Continuous Integration** or **\"CI\"**. In addition to
> Automated Build Studio there are Open Source CI servers such as
> CruiseControl.NET.
>
> The main benefit of a CI server is to reduce the amount of time it
> takes to execute your test automation as well as ensure that it
> executes against every build. By setting up a CI server you can not
> only free your QA engineers from having to manually execute their
> tests. CI helps quickly identify tests that are unable to consistently
> run to completion and may require closer scrutiny. In addition, many
> CI servers include a means of publishing test results providing for
> greater visibility into the automation efforts.
>
> []{#General .anchor}**General**

>
> Record/Playback is a quick and easy way to get automated tests up and

>
> Use the TestItems of the project as a framework for Test Cases (see

### Appendix B - Types of Testing

20. []{#Appendix_B_-_Types_of_Testing .anchor}**Appendix B - Types of
    Testing**

> []{#Types_of_Testing .anchor}**Types of Testing**

#### Manual Testing

> Manual Testing is where a tester methodically exercises the features
> of a product or product area without the aid of test automation. The
> single greatest strength of manual testing is that it is truly
> real-world testing, meaning that the tester can utilize the
> application under test the same way an end user would. Through manual
> testing the tester can provide a wide variety of feedback about the
> application under test not limited to simply reproducing bugs.
>
> Manual tests are difficult to perform on a regular basis. The major
> weakness of manual testing is that it is time consuming, tedious and
> requires extended periods of focused attention. Manual testing tends
> to be quite error prone, leading to situations where consistently
> reproducing a bug can be very difficult.

#### Functional Testing

> Functional Testing focuses on interactions with an application\'s user
> interface (UI) via the mouse, keyboard or other input device with
> particular attention to how the application visually responds to
> input. The goal of Functional Testing is to methodically cover all of
> the various UI features exposed by an application. Functional Testing
> should be highly organized and structured in a manner that allows for
> additional tests to easily be incorporated as new features are added.

#### Unit Testing

> Unit Testing focuses on smaller atomic portions of an application.
> Typically, Unit Testing requires internal knowledge of how an
> application performs and seeks to test portions (objects, methods and
> function) of an application in isolation. In many cases, applications
> have to be designed with Unit Testing in mind in order for this type
> of testing to be truly effective. The benefit of unit testing is that
> it tends to force application developers to write smaller, well
> defined routines with fewer dependencies allowing for highly specific
> tests to be developed.

#### Regression Testing

> Regression Testing is the process of executing tests in a repeatable
> manner and comparing the latest results with previous test executions
> to ensure that the same outcome is achieved. Regression Testing is
> extremely important and is the means of realizing the value of test
> automation. Repeatedly executing tests over time allows you to verify
> the application is still performing as intended.

#### Distributed Testing

> Distributed Testing is the act of farming different portions of a test
> out to separate machines for execution. Distributed Testing is useful
> for simulating real world interactions on a networked application such
> as a web site or web service and can exercise functionality designed
> to handle concurrent use of application resources including, but not
> restricted to data.

#### HTTP Performance Testing

> HTTP Performance Testing is the simulation of real-world interactions
> with a web application from multiple machines. TestComplete provides
> the ability to leverage networked computers and virtual users to
> simultaneously submit HTTP transactions to a web application.

#### Multi-Tier

> In software development there are typically three Tiers which are used
> to describe various aspects of an application they are Client Tier,
> Middle Tier and Data Tier. These are each defined as:
>
> **Client** \-- The user interface or presentation of an application
> and its data which is typically covered through Functional Testing.
>
> **Data Tier** \-- The storage of an application\'s data which can be
> exercised by Functional Testing as well as Unit Testing
>
> **Middle Tier** \-- Refers to the portion of the application
> responsible for moving data back and forth between the Client and the
> Data Tiers. The code that resides in this Tier can be tested from
> either the Client Tier via Functional testing or through Unit Testing
> on the code in the Middle Tier itself. Keep in mind that these are not
> strict rules as to which type of testing should be used but more
> illustrative how the different types of testing can be used.
