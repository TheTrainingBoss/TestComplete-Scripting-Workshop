### Manual Testing

Manual Testing
==============

Objectives
----------

> This chapter looks at TestComplete support for Manual Testing
> including how to create, edit and execute Manual Tests. You\'ll learn
> about the upgrade path from manual to automatic tests using the
> TestComplete import and export features. You\'ll also learn how to use
> events within a manual test to allow interaction between manual and
> automated tests.

[]{#_bookmark287 .anchor}

About Manual Testing
--------------------

> If you've worked in any sort of Quality Assurance capacity you\'ll
> likely be intimately familiar with manual testing and perhaps more so
> than you might like. Manual testing while extremely valuable can be
> difficult for humans to perform consistently over long periods of time
> because of human nature itself. Manual testing generally takes a great
> deal of concentration and dedicated effort to consistently produce
> results. TestComplete provides an alternative to what could be
> considered the more classical approach of using Microsoft Word or
> Excel. TestComplete support for manual testing allows the test
> developer to guide the tester through a series of steps, capture data
> as the test is being performed and automatically log the results of
> the test. The benefits of manual testing through TestComplete are:
>
> The assurance that the required steps are followed Generation of a log
> file for every test execution Verification of the results based on
> Test Log contents Ability to interact with a manual test using Events
>
> Below is an example of the TestComplete manual test user interface:

height="3.0468744531933507in"}

> **Figure 207 \-- Creating the Manual Tests Project Item**

64. Click **OK** on the **Create Project Item** dialog.

65. Right click the **ManualTests** node in the Project Explorer and
    select **Add \| New Item\...**

> to create a new Manual Test.

66. On the **Create Project Item** dialog enter \"CreateOrder\" as the
    name of the manual test and click **OK** to open the Manual Test
    Editor.

height="1.7806244531933508in"}

> **Figure 208 \--Creating the Manual Test Item**

#### Manual Test Editor

> The TestComplete Manual Test Editor allows for the creation of a
> multi-step test that prompts the user through a series of
> instructions, collecting results with every step.

![](./media/image300.png){width="5.929561461067366in"
height="3.8906244531933507in"}

> **Figure 209 \--Manual Test Editor**

#### Manual Test Editor Controls

  **Field**               **Description**
  ----------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Test Steps**          Tree of the steps contained within this test, used for navigation while editing.
  **Test Caption**        Window caption of the Manual Test dialog.
  **ID**                  Step ID for use within Manual Test events.
  **Test Description**    Sub caption of the Manual Test dialog.
  **Test Instructions**   Free-form HTML markup for communicating the actual actions to be performed during the test. Appears in the main portion of the Manual Test dialog.

  **Field**                     **Description**
  ----------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Test notes and comments**   Notes for the test writer that are not displayed when the test is executed.

#### Editing the Test Description

> By default, the **Manual Test Editor** opens with only the initial
> node created so we\'ll need to add steps to fill out the test. To
> create a Manual Test description:

1.  Click the **Test Caption** field and enter \"Create Order Manual
    Test\".

2.  Edit the **Test Description** field and set the text to \"In this
    test we will create a new customer order and validate a new record
    is created.\"

3.  Edit the **Test Instructions** field and set the test to \"Using the
    Orders sample application we will add a new order and verify the
    data appears in the list of customer orders.\" The result should
    look like the following:

![](./media/image301.png){width="5.93113188976378in" height="3.88125in"}

> **Figure 210 \--The Manual Test Editor with Test Description**

#### Adding Steps

> Once the description is completed we can start adding steps to the
> test as follows:

1.  Click the green (+) sign or right click in the Test Steps area and
    select **New Step** from the context menu.

![](./media/image302.png){width="3.112386264216973in"
height="1.7221872265966753in"}

> **Figure 211 \--Adding a new step to the Manual Test**

2.  Fill out the Step **Caption**, **Description** and **Instructions**
    for this step of our Manual Test. The actual information can be
    arbitrary or you can use the screenshot below to guide you.

![](./media/image303.png){width="5.941329833770778in"
height="4.523748906386702in"}

> **Figure 212 \--Completed Manual Test**

3.  Add one more manual step and fill out the Step **Caption**,
    **Description** and **Instructions**

> for this step

#### Running Manual Tests

> Manual Tests are run from Script using the name of the test followed
> by the **Start()** method. The manual test object also comes with
> **Suspend()** and **Resume()** methods that can be used in event
> handlers.
>
> ManualTest1.Start(); ManualTest1.Start()

Manual Test Interaction With Automated Tests
--------------------------------------------

> In this topic we\'ll illustrate how manual tests interact with
> automated tests. You can call a manual test from a Keyword Test or
> Script. The reverse is also true. You an call Keyword Tests or Script
> from your manual test.
>
> You might be thinking \"Why would I do this?\" which is a fair
> question. The interesting thing about Manual Tests in TestComplete is
> that you can augment a test by performing actions automatically for
> the user and by incorporating a Manual Test into a Keyword Test or
> Script you can execute any actions necessary to ease the testing
> process such as setup test data, create/delete files, launch
> applications etc. You can also replace parts of your manual test
> incrementally as circumstances dictate, allowing you to move over to
> automated testing in a controlled manner.

Exporting a Manual Test
-----------------------

> Once you\'ve created a manual test you\'re given two options to export
> the test content using the context menu to either Microsoft Word or
> HTML:

![](./media/image304.png){width="3.47748687664042in"
height="4.145833333333333in"}

> **Figure 213 \--Exporting Manual Tests**
>
> TestComplete provides an option to customize the Microsoft Word export
> template on the Properties tab at the bottom of the editor window. The
> export functionality works in a mail merge like fashion and allows you
> to create a Microsoft Word document containing the contents of the
> test.

![](./media/image305.jpeg){width="5.900073272090989in"
height="4.368124453193351in"}

> **Figure 214 \--Manual Test Editor Properties tab**
>
> You can optionally, define your own Microsoft Word template for use
> with the TestComplete export feature. TestComplete includes a default
> template that looks like this:

![](./media/image306.jpeg){width="5.943008530183727in"
height="4.045416666666667in"}

> **Figure 215 \--TestCompleteDefault Microsoft Word Template**

Importing a Manual Test
-----------------------

> The ability to migrate existing legacy manual tests can be a huge time
> saver. TestComplete lets you import manual tests stored in text files,
> Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel files. TestComplete can handle
> several format arrangements:
>
> One level or multilevel, bulleted or numbered lists. Numbered lists
> can use any number style and formatting for levels.
>
> Test steps using different indents for steps of different levels.
> Tables used to organize the step hierarchy.
>
> Keywords to separate the step caption, description, instructions and
> notes.
>
> TestComplete ships with a set of sample files that can be imported.
> Each file demonstrates a particular format, e.g. text, Excel, Word
> document with headers, etc. The closer your files are to the example
> formats, the less editing you will need to perform in the Manual Tests
> editor. See the online help for complete details on supported formats.
>
> You can find example files to import at:
>
> \\TestComplete Samples\\Manual Testing\\Recommended Formats for Manual
> Test Instructions

#### Simple Text File Import

> If you open the document titled \"Test Instructions in .txt file.txt\"
> you will see steps for testing the Orders application that use numbers
> to indicate each step.

![](./media/image307.png){width="5.492455161854768in"
height="4.28125in"}

> **Figure 216 \--Sample Text File**
>
> If you open the document titled \"Test Instructions in .doc file
> (using headings).doc" you will see steps for testing the Orders
> application that uses the \"Heading1\" style to indicate a new step.

![](./media/image308.jpeg){width="5.929838145231846in" height="5.16in"}

> **Figure 217 \--Sample Import Document**
>
> Test steps can even be arranged in a hierarchy by using styles, i.e.
> \"Heading1\", \"Heading2\", where \"Heading2\" represents the set of
> steps indented from \"Heading1\".
>
> See the TestComplete online help topic \"Importing Manual Tests\" for
> detailed formatting information for each document type.

#### Lab

> Let\'s walk through importing one of the sample documents.

1.  From the TestComplete **File** menu choose **Import \| Test\...**

Legacy Migration
----------------

> The ability to import legacy manual test steps stored in external
> files coupled with TestComplete tools for converting Manual Test to
> fully automated Keyword Tests comprises a complete migration path.
> This path takes you from the labor-intensive, error prone and
> inconsistent to a wholly automated system that can be run reliably on
> a schedule.

Summary
-------

> In this chapter, we explored TestComplete Manual Testing features and
> discussed the advantages of developing manual tests using
> TestComplete. We learned to:
>
> Create, edit and execute Manual Tests. Call Manual Tests.
>
> Use Events within a Manual Test. Import and Export Manual Tests.

### Low Level Procedures

Low Level Procedures
====================

Objectives
----------

> This chapter explains TestComplete Low Level Procedure functionality
> and how it can be leveraged to deal with situations where they may be
> no easy alternative. You'll learn how to record, edit and execute Low
> Level Procedures. Along the way you will learn how Low-Level
> Procedures differ from standard test recordings, when to use a
> Low-Level Procedure and the difference between Window and Screen Low
> Level Procedures.

About Low Level Procedures
--------------------------

> Low Level Procedures are an alternative recording type provided by
> TestComplete where actual mouse and keyboard events are recorded. Low
> Level Procedures differ dramatically from standard recordings where
> TestComplete records higher level actions against specific onscreen
> objects.

#### Low Level Procedure Types

> There are two kinds of Low Level Procedures:
>
> **Screen Coordinates** \-- Captures events relative to the entire
> screen where the top left-hand corner of the screen is 0,0.
>
> **Window Coordinates** \-- Captures events relative to a user selected
> Window where the top left-hand corner of the window is 0,0.
>
> Window Coordinate Low Level Procedures tend to be more reliable as
> they are unaffected by the location of the selected window and will
> playback relative to the Window\'s current screen location.

#### When To Use Low Level Procedures

> From the outset, tests that rely on screen coordinates generally are a
> bad idea and usually that holds true regardless of which tool you're
> using. However, in certain situations you may find yourself attempting
> to record a scenario that simply refuses to playback properly due to
> the complexity of capturing a user\'s intent via a recorder. In these
> cases, resorting to Low Level Procedures can, at the very least, serve
> as a stop-gap until alternative solutions can be developed.
>
> Additionally, you can work on applications using third party controls
> not directly supported by TestComplete and that provide no visibility
> into the client region of the control such as a custom grid.

Recording Low Level Procedures
------------------------------

> In the \"Web Testing\" chapter we looked at a Web application that
> used JavaScript to dynamically display menu items on screen. The
> application poses an interesting challenge for GUI recorders that tend
> to capture interactions with controls such as clicks and keystrokes.
> Let\'s take a look at recording a Low-Level Window Coordinates
> Procedure to handle the menu selection and understand this alternative
> approach to recording.

#### Low Level Window Coordinates Procedure

67. For starters we\'ll launch Internet Explorer and browse to the
    Orders application located here:

> [http:*//training.falafel.com/dynamiccontent*](http://training.falafel.com/dynamiccontent)

68. Select **File \| New \| Project\...** and on the **Create Project**
    dialog click the **OK** button.

69. Start recording a new test. From the Recorder toolbar, drop down the
    Low-Level Procedure button and select the **Record Low-Level
    Procedure (window coordinates)** option.

Calling Low Level Procedures from Script
----------------------------------------

> To run a Low Level Procedure from a Keyword Test, first specify the
> collection followed by a period \".\", then the name of the low level
> procedure, another period \".\" and finally the **Execute()** method.
> If you want the low-level procedure to execute in relation to a
> particular window, pass the window as a parameter to the Execute
> method. Also notice in the example below that before executing the
> low-level procedure, you want to make sure that the window is
> activated and brought to the front.
>
> **var** iexplore = Aliases.iexplore.IEFrame; iexplore.Activate();
> LLCollection1.LLP1.Execute(iexplore);
>
> **Dim** iexplore = Aliases.iexplore.IEFrame iexplore.Activate()
> LLCollection1.LLP1.Execute(iexplore)

Summary
-------

> In this chapter, we looked at TestComplete Low Level Procedure
> capabilities and: Explained how this recording type differs from a
> standard object-based recording Recorded a scenario which otherwise
> requires special handling
>
> Examined the Low-Level Procedure Editor

### User Forms

User Forms
==========

Objectives
----------

> This chapter demonstrates how User Forms are used to display dialogs
> and windows onscreen during test execution. You\'ll learn how to use
> the TestComplete User Form\'s designer to create your own forms.
> You\'ll also see how modal and non-modal display modes manage form
> display during test execution.

[]{#Materials .anchor}

> **Using the Designer**
>
> User Forms are not part of the default project template so you\'ll
> first need to add the **User Forms** Project Item to your project.
> Once you\'ve added User Forms support to your project you can right
> click the User Forms node in the Project Explorer and add a form to
> your project. In this example, we\'ll construct a User Form that can
> be used to prompt for login credentials.

![](./media/image322.png){width="2.613190069991251in"
height="1.8356244531933508in"}

> **Figure 231 \--User Form s Login Dialog**
>
> Once the form is created you will see the User Forms designer which is
> similar in style to those seen in Visual Basic, Visual Studio or other
> development tools supporting forms development. If you are familiar
> with any of these tools you\'ll immediately feel right at home in the
> designer. If not, don\'t fear. Learning the designer is quick and easy
> and you\'ll be able to construct dialogs in no time.

#### Layout of the User Forms Designer

> There are three panels of the User Forms editor including:

75. Component palette

76. Form Designer

77. Properties window

height="3.9459372265966755in"}

> **Figure 232 \--User Forms Editor**

#### Building a User Form

> To illustrate the functionality of the User Forms designer we\'ll
> build a Login dialog that you can call from within your tests. If the
> UserForms node doesn\'t already exist in the project explorer,
> right-click the project and select **Add \| New Item**. Choose \"User
> Forms\" from the list and click **OK** to create the project item.

> **Figure 234 \--Adding a User Form**
>
> Using the Component palette, we\'ll add the components (TcxTextEdit,
> TcxLabel and TcxButton) from the **Editors**, **Helpers** and
> **Buttons** categories respectively to the form by simply double
> clicking the components. After adding a component to the design-time
> form you can use the mouse to move/size the control and the Properties
> window to change its appearance/behavior. We now have a form that
> looks like this:

height="2.900624453193351in"}

> **Figure 235 \--Initial User Forms Layout**
>
> Next, we need to make the following property changes on the components
> placed on the form. The table below lists the components and the
> property/values for each. These changes improve the appearance of the
> dialog as well as set the expected behavior of a modal login dialog.

> To solve this problem, you'll want to focus on getting your test

> The preparation we\'re referring to has to do with your choice of

> with respect to the testing facilities available in TestComplete. You

> TestComplete is rich with features that make test automation easier
> although like any development tool it provides many different ways to
> solve the same problem. For example, TestComplete has a powerful and
> indeed almost alluring recorder, making it easy to quickly create
> automated tests. While a test recorder is a great tool, recorded tests
> tend to be more brittle than hand written tests because they capture a
> single iteration at a given point in time and don\'t take into account
> unexpected events like an error dialog popping up. The alternative is
> handwritten tests where you can methodically plan how the test will
> react in unexpected circumstances. The down side of handwritten tests
> is they tend to take longer to develop though over the long run
> they\'ll likely require less maintenance because of the tendency to
> design the test more rigorously.

> order to maintain consistency across your testing organization you
> should work towards creating a project template(s) that\'s
> pre-configured for your test environment. For example, if you\'re
> testing a Window 32-bit GUI application, create a Project Template
> that has the Tested Applications node with your application already

> []{#Your_Most_Important_Test .anchor}**Your Most Important Test**
>
> Arguably, the first test you should focus on is a \"smoke test\". In
> this section we\'ll discuss what a smoke test is and provide guidance
> as to how to construct the test in such a way as to maximize its
> effectiveness.

#### Creating a Smoke Test

> Probably the most important test you\'ll write is your Smoke Test, at
> least it should be. Typically, the goal of a Smoke Test is to verify
> that the latest build delivered to QA is either worth further
> consideration or \"DOA\" (dead on arrival). The smoke test is crucial
> because of the time savings it can provide both R&D and QA. A good
> Smoke Test should:
>
> Run quickly \-- a smoke test should not last for hours but minutes and
> test the most crucial functionality.
>
> Fail quickly \-- as soon as a failure is detected in the smoke test
> should end and trigger a failure notification.
>
> Cover a broad range of functionality, focusing on breadth not depth.
> Require minimal setup/configuration of the application under test. Be
> setup to run against every build.
>
> Adapt over time as the application under test evolves. Serve as a
> model for new test automation.
>
> If you take the time to organize your Smoke Test to cover these goals
> you will undoubtedly save time and resources over the long run. Your
> Smoke Test should serve as a model that embodies your \"best
> practices\" from which your QA team can draw from for their own tests.
>
> If you\'ve never written a Smoke Test before, start small. In the
> beginning simply get the smoke test to verify even a single piece of
> functionality consistently. Over time, work to increase its coverage
> but remain focused on the quality of the test. It\'s unacceptable to
> have a Smoke Test that can\'t run consistently and without problems.

#### Executing your Tests Regularly

> Once your Smoke Test is written and under version control the next
> step is to automate its execution. SmartBear has a product called
> Automated Build Studio which can automate your TestComplete tests and
> trigger them to execute when a new build is delivered to QA, a process
> called **Continuous Integration** or **\"CI\"**. In addition to
> Automated Build Studio there are Open Source CI servers such as
> CruiseControl.NET.
>
> The main benefit of a CI server is to reduce the amount of time it
> takes to execute your test automation as well as ensure that it
> executes against every build. By setting up a CI server you can not
> only free your QA engineers from having to manually execute their
> tests. CI helps quickly identify tests that are unable to consistently
> run to completion and may require closer scrutiny. In addition, many
> CI servers include a means of publishing test results providing for
> greater visibility into the automation efforts.

>
> Record/Playback is a quick and easy way to get automated tests up and

>
> Use the TestItems of the project as a framework for Test Cases (see

>
> Separate Data from the Test Framework (see \"Data Driven Testing\").
>
> Use the code metrics of the Code Explorer to improve the quality of

>
> Use reusable routines whenever possible (see the \"Project

### Appendix B - Types of Testing

20. []{#Appendix_B_-_Types_of_Testing .anchor}**Appendix B - Types of
    Testing**

> []{#Types_of_Testing .anchor}**Types of Testing**

#### Manual Testing

> Manual Testing is where a tester methodically exercises the features
> of a product or product area without the aid of test automation. The
> single greatest strength of manual testing is that it is truly
> real-world testing, meaning that the tester can utilize the
> application under test the same way an end user would. Through manual
> testing the tester can provide a wide variety of feedback about the
> application under test not limited to simply reproducing bugs.
>
> Manual tests are difficult to perform on a regular basis. The major
> weakness of manual testing is that it is time consuming, tedious and
> requires extended periods of focused attention. Manual testing tends
> to be quite error prone, leading to situations where consistently
> reproducing a bug can be very difficult.

#### Functional Testing

> Functional Testing focuses on interactions with an application\'s user
> interface (UI) via the mouse, keyboard or other input device with
> particular attention to how the application visually responds to
> input. The goal of Functional Testing is to methodically cover all of
> the various UI features exposed by an application. Functional Testing
> should be highly organized and structured in a manner that allows for
> additional tests to easily be incorporated as new features are added.

#### Unit Testing

> Unit Testing focuses on smaller atomic portions of an application.
> Typically, Unit Testing requires internal knowledge of how an
> application performs and seeks to test portions (objects, methods and
> function) of an application in isolation. In many cases, applications
> have to be designed with Unit Testing in mind in order for this type
> of testing to be truly effective. The benefit of unit testing is that
> it tends to force application developers to write smaller, well
> defined routines with fewer dependencies allowing for highly specific
> tests to be developed.

#### Regression Testing

> Regression Testing is the process of executing tests in a repeatable
> manner and comparing the latest results with previous test executions
> to ensure that the same outcome is achieved. Regression Testing is
> extremely important and is the means of realizing the value of test
> automation. Repeatedly executing tests over time allows you to verify
> the application is still performing as intended.

#### Distributed Testing

> Distributed Testing is the act of farming different portions of a test
> out to separate machines for execution. Distributed Testing is useful
> for simulating real world interactions on a networked application such
> as a web site or web service and can exercise functionality designed
> to handle concurrent use of application resources including, but not
> restricted to data.

#### HTTP Performance Testing

> HTTP Performance Testing is the simulation of real-world interactions
> with a web application from multiple machines. TestComplete provides
> the ability to leverage networked computers and virtual users to
> simultaneously submit HTTP transactions to a web application.

#### Multi-Tier

> In software development there are typically three Tiers which are used
> to describe various aspects of an application they are Client Tier,
> Middle Tier and Data Tier. These are each defined as:
>
> **Client** \-- The user interface or presentation of an application
> and its data which is typically covered through Functional Testing.
>
> **Data Tier** \-- The storage of an application\'s data which can be
> exercised by Functional Testing as well as Unit Testing
>
> **Middle Tier** \-- Refers to the portion of the application
> responsible for moving data back and forth between the Client and the
> Data Tiers. The code that resides in this Tier can be tested from
> either the Client Tier via Functional testing or through Unit Testing
> on the code in the Middle Tier itself. Keep in mind that these are not
> strict rules as to which type of testing should be used but more
> illustrative how the different types of testing can be used.
